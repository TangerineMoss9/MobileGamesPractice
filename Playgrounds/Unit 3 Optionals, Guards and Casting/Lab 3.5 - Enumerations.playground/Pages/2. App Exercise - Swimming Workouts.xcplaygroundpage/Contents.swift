 ## App Exercise - Swimming Workouts
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 Previous app exercises have introduced the idea that your fitness tracking app may allow users to track swimming workouts. Create a `SwimmingWorkout` struct below with properties for `distance`, `time`, and `stroke`. `distance` and `time` should be of type `Double` and will represent distance in meters and time in seconds, and `stroke` should be of type `String`.
 */
struct swimmingWorkout{
    var startTime:Double
    var endTime:Double
    var stroke:Stroke
    
    enum Stroke{
        case freestyle, butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke
    }
    
    static var freestyleWorkouts:[swimmingWorkout] = []
    static var butterflyWorkouts:[swimmingWorkout] = []
    static var backstrokeWorkouts:[swimmingWorkout] = []
    static var breaststrokeWorkouts:[swimmingWorkout] = []

    func Save(){
        switch stroke {
        case .freestyle:
            swimmingWorkout.freestyleWorkouts.append(self)
        case .butterfly:
            swimmingWorkout.butterflyWorkouts.append(self)
        case .backstroke:
            swimmingWorkout.backstrokeWorkouts.append(self)
        case .breaststroke:
            swimmingWorkout.breaststrokeWorkouts.append(self)
        default:
            return
        }
        
    }
}
/*:
 Allowing `stroke` to be of type `String` isn't very type-safe. Inside the `SwimmingWorkout` struct, create an enum called `Stroke` that has cases for `freestyle`, `butterfly`, `backstroke`, and `breaststroke`. Change the type of `stroke` from `String` to `Stroke`. Create two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` objects.
 */
var swim1 = swimmingWorkout(startTime: 19, endTime: 43, stroke: .freestyle)
var swim2 = swimmingWorkout(startTime: 16, endTime: 65, stroke: .backstroke)
/*:
 Now imagine you want to log swimming workouts separately based on the swimming stroke. You might use arrays as static variables on `SwimmingWorkout` for this. Add four static variables, `freestyleWorkouts`, `butterflyWorkouts`, `backstrokeWorkouts`, and `breaststrokeWorkouts`, to `SwimmingWorkout` above. Each should be of type `[SwimmingWorkout]` and should default to empty arrays.
 */


/*:
 Now add an instance method to `SwimmingWorkout` called `save()` that takes no parameters and has no return value. This method will add its instance to the static array on `SwimmingWorkout` that corresponds to its swimming stroke. Inside `save()` write a switch statement that switches on the instance's `stroke` property, and appends `self` to the proper array. Call save on the two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` that you created above, and then print the array(s) to which they should have been added to see if your `save` method works properly.
 */
swim1.Save()
swim2.Save()

print(swimmingWorkout.freestyleWorkouts)
print(swimmingWorkout.backstrokeWorkouts)
